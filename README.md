# rocketlaunch
Problem Statement
is to build a terminal-based Rocket Launch Simulator. The goal is to simulate a rocket launch that places a satellite into orbit, while
providing real-time updates to the user. The simulator will operate in discrete time steps, each representing one second of the mission.
